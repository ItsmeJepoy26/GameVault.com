        <p>Who We Are</p>
We are a dedicated group of students from the University of Science and Technology of Southern Philippines - Claveria Campus, pursuing our Bachelor of Science in Information Technology, 2A. As part of our curriculum for PIT IT223 - Web Systems and Technologies, we have come together to develop and showcase our skills through various projects and assignments.

Our journey in the field of IT has been both challenging and rewarding, as we constantly strive to stay updated with the latest trends and technologies. We believe in the power of collaboration and the importance of hands-on experience, which is why we actively participate in practical projects that allow us to apply theoretical knowledge in real-world scenarios.

Throughout our academic career, we have gained experience in different areas of information technology, including web development, database management, and software engineering. We are passionate about leveraging technology to solve problems and create innovative solutions that can have a positive impact on society.

This project is a testament to our commitment to excellence and our passion for learning. It has been an incredible opportunity for us to work together, exchange ideas, and enhance our skills. We are excited to present our work and hope it reflects the dedication and hard work we have put into it.
